# NGcodeX Community: Coding Standards

Welcome to the NGcodeX community! To maintain a consistent and high-quality codebase, we have established the following coding standards. When contributing to NGcodeX projects, please adhere to these guidelines:

## Table of Contents

1. [General Principles](#1-general-principles)
2. [Naming Conventions](#2-naming-conventions)
3. [Code Formatting](#3-code-formatting)
4. [Documentation](#4-documentation)
5. [Comments](#5-comments)
6. [Error Handling](#6-error-handling)
7. [Testing](#7-testing)

## 1. General Principles

- Write code that is clear, readable, and maintainable.
- Follow the principle of least astonishment - code should behave as expected.
- Keep functions and methods focused on a single responsibility.

## 2. Naming Conventions

- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.

## 3. Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) throughout the codebase.
- Follow a consistent line length, typically 80-120 characters per line.
- Configure your editor to use consistent formatting settings.

## 4. Documentation

- Provide clear and concise documentation for all code.
- Include comments for complex logic or where clarity is needed.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with the code changes.

## 5. Comments

- Use comments sparingly and only when necessary.
- Write comments in clear English, explaining the why and not just the what.
- Avoid redundant comments that duplicate the code.

## 6. Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
- Log errors with sufficient information to aid in debugging.

## 7. Testing

- Write comprehensive tests for your code.
- Ensure that tests cover both normal and edge cases.
- Run tests locally before submitting a pull request.

## Acknowledgement

By contributing to NGcodeX, you agree to follow these coding standards. Consistency in coding practices helps maintain a healthy and collaborative community.
